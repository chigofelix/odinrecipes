    <p>Egusi soup is an insanely delicious, and it is easy to make. This is not because it is my best soup, but because it stands out among other soups in Nigeria. For this reason, it has been crowned the ceremonial soup of Nigeria, taken aongside different kinds of swallows, like eba, fufu, pounded yam, semo, and the likes. I can tell you, this soup is the truth. It is simple and quick to make.</p>
    <p>You may think I'm hyping the soup, but believe me, I'm just stating the facts. Let's get into it</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Ground melon</li>
        <li>Smoked turkey</li>
        <li>Smoked Mackerel</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Two beef stock cubes</li>
        <li>Nigerian pepper mix</li>
        <li>Palm oil</li>
        <li>Crayfish</li>
        <li>Locust beans</li>
        <li>Palm oil</li>
        <li>Spinach</li>
        <li>Chopped onions</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Cooking Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour the ground melon into a bowl. Add about a cup of water and mix to form a paste, then set aside. Wash and chop the spinach, drain in a colander and set aside.</li>
        <li>Place a big pan on medium heat. Add palm oil to the pan, and heat for about 3 minutes (do not bleach oil). Add the reserved chopped onions and sautee till translucent.</li>
        <li>Add the pepper mix and locust beans, then stir to combine. Bring to boil for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the egusi paste in bits to pepper, reduce the heat, do not stir and cover the pot with a lid. Cook for another 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the lid, and gently stir the soup. The egusi would be lumpy at this point, use the back of a ladle to break the lumps till you have acchieved your desired texture.</li>
        <li>Add the smoked turkey, the ground crayfish, the beef stock cubes, and salt, then stir to combine. Taste and adjust for salt accordingly. Continue to cook for another 10 minutes, check at intervals and stir to avoid burning if need be.</li>
        <li>Shred the smoked mackerel. Add and gently stir it into the soup. Add chopped spinach, then stir to combine and cook for another 3 to 5 minutes. Then take it off the heat, allow it to cool for about 10 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>That sums up the preparation process of egusi soup. Please do not forget to check out other recipes at the <a href="../index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">home page</a>.</p>
